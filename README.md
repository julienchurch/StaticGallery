# StaticGallery

StaticGallery is a standalone SCSS mixin to create a gallery with fixed-width columns.

The API is tries to be stupid simple while remaining unopinionated. Peep it:


```
@include staticGallery( <columnWidth>
                      , <gutterVertical>
                      , <gutterHorizontal>
                      , <galleryPadding>
                      , [galleryMaxWidth: 1200px]
                      , [class: "__gallery-item"] );
```

Because the gallery is static, `@media` breakpoints are automatically generated based on the values you provide. If you're targeting specific breakpoints, you must work them into your column and gutter dimensions. (Think about itâ€”it wouldn't work any other way.) 

##Explanation of parameters

###Parameters: 

  **$columnWidth**
    The width that each column (and thereby each gallery item) should be.

  **$gutterVertical**
    The margin between columns.

  **$gutterHorizontal**  
  The margin between rows.

  **$galleryPadding:**
    The amount of padding on each side of the gallery. Top and bottom
    padding are unimportant to this calculation and should be set outside
    this API.

  **$galleryMaxWidth:**
    The maximum width that you wish the gallery to support. Any viewport size
    beyond this width will be ignored. Defaults to `1200px`.

  **$class**
    The class you have set your gallery items to. Defaults to `.gallery-item`

##Example use

```scss
.gallery {
  @include staticGallery(225px, 24px, 50px, 14px, $galleryMaxWidth: 1000px, $class: ".item");
  .item {
    background: #222;
    min-height: 100px; // Heights are NOT set by the mixin
    overflow: hidden;
  }
}
```
